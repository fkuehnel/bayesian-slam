## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper *Higher-Order Uncertainty Propagation and Saddlepoint Marginalization on the SE(3) Lie Group*, which develops a self-contained framework for Bayesian inference over rigid body poses.

**Paper:** [SE3_inference_paper.pdf](paper/SE3_inference_paper.pdf)

The core ideas originate from work at NASA Ames Research Center (2006) on [robust pose estimation using the SE(3) Lie group](paper/robustEst.pdf) structure. This project refocuses that foundational material into contributions aimed at the broader estimation and inference community. All formulas have been verified symbolically (Mathematica) and numerically (Rust finite differences, Python, Monte Carlo).

## What This Paper Contributes

### 1. Second-Order Uncertainty Propagation on SE(3)

Current filters and optimizers (EKF, IEKF, factor graphs) propagate pose uncertainty using first-order Jacobians. On SE(3), the semi-direct product coupling between rotation and translation introduces systematic bias that first-order methods miss. We derive:

- Composition Jacobians including the novel compact closed-form rotation-translation coupling Jacobian **J_t(Ω, t)**
- Second-order corrections to both the mean and covariance of composed poses
- Explicit formulas using the finite BCH composition via SU(2), avoiding truncated series

**Verified:** Monte Carlo validation (10⁵ samples) confirms a 1.83× improvement in covariance accuracy at σ_ω ≈ 0.2 rad. BCH truncation errors verified across 4 decades (see Table 1 in paper).

### 2. Saddlepoint Marginalization for Projective Observations

When camera observations are projective (x/z, y/z), the joint posterior over pose and 3D landmarks is non-Gaussian in the pose parameters. Standard Laplace approximation (Schur complement in bundle adjustment) misses this asymmetry. We develop:

- A saddlepoint correction with the formula c₁ = (1/12)A + (1/8)B − (1/8)Q₄
- Two distinct cubic contraction types (cross: 6/15 Isserlis pairings, trace: 9/15)
- Quartic term with correct negative sign (from exp(−g₄) ≈ 1 − g₄)
- **Closed-form Q₄**: analytical quartic contraction using only existing projective derivatives (P, H, D3) — no 4th derivatives of π needed (the D4·e term vanishes at the mode)
- Validity guard: correction applied only when |c₁| < 0.5 (σ_depth/depth ≲ 0.3)

**Verified:** Against numerical quadrature, the saddlepoint achieves 6 significant figures (3.2×10⁻⁶ relative error) compared to Laplace's 0.94% error — a ~3000× improvement.

### 3. Complete SE(3) Algebra Toolkit

The paper provides a self-contained reference for the SE(3) machinery, all symbolically verified. This machinery is equivalent to the standard toolkit in **Solà, et. al**, and extends it: 

- Exponential/logarithmic maps with Lie-Cartan coordinates of the first kind (already known)
- Closed-form finite Rodrigues vector composition via the SU(2)/Z₂ ≅ SO(3) double cover
- Phase reflection handling at Θ = π with cutline analysis
- Wei-Norman formula and both left/right Rodrigues Jacobians
- Key identities: S⁻¹ = J_ωl, S⁻¹R = RS⁻¹ = J_ωr (verified to machine precision)
- det S = 2(1−cosΘ)/Θ² (strictly positive, guarantees invertibility)

## Notation Correspondence with Solà et al. / Barfoot

The paper includes Appendix F (§F) that maps our conventions to those of Solà, Deray & Atchuthan ("A micro Lie theory," 2018) and Barfoot (*State Estimation for Robotics*, 2024). This assists readers familiar with either reference.

### Block ordering

The fundamental difference is tangent vector ordering:

| | Solà/Barfoot (SDA) | This paper |
|---|---|---|
| Tangent vector | τ = [**ρ**; **θ**] (translation first) | τ = [**Ω**; **t**] (rotation first) |
| Primary Jacobian | Left: J_l | Right: J_r = J_l(−τ) |

All 6×6 matrices are related by the block permutation P = [[0, I₃]; [I₃, 0]], i.e. **M** = P **M**^SDA P.

### Key object correspondence

| Object | SDA / Barfoot | This paper | Relationship |
|---|---|---|---|
| S matrix | **V**(θ), Eq. 174 | **S**(Ω) | Identical formula |
| S⁻¹ | (not identified) | **S**⁻¹ = J_ωl | **Our identity** |
| Adjoint | [[R, [t]×R]; [0, R]] | [[R, 0]; [[T]×R, R]] | Block permutation |
| 6×6 left Jac | [[J_l, **Q**]; [0, J_l]] | [[J_ωl, 0]; [Q̃, J_ωl]] | Block permutation |
| 6×6 right Jac | J_l(−ρ,−θ) | [[J_ωr, 0]; [J_t, J_ωr]] | Block permutation |
| Coupling block | **Q**(ρ,θ) (Barfoot, 4-line expansion) | J_t (compact T-form) | J_t = Q(−t,−Ω)·J_ωr |
| Point action Jac | [R, −R[p]×] | [−R[x]×, I] | Block swap; body frame |

### Three additional identities (not in SDA/Barfoot)

1. **S⁻¹ = J_ωl = J_ωr(−Ω)** — Halves cost: evaluate J_ωl instead of inverting S numerically. Also implies S⁻¹R = RS⁻¹ = J_ωr.

2. **det S = 2(1 − cos Θ)/Θ²** — Exact volume element for Lie-Cartan coordinate chart. Needed for density transformations between [Ω, t] and [Ω, T] coordinates. Continuous at Θ = 0 (det S → 1), vanishes at Θ = 2π.

3. **Compact T-form coupling Jacobian** — Single-line formula for ∂[S⁻¹T]/∂Ω with projector decomposition into axial and transverse components, replacing Barfoot's four-line iterated cross-product expansion. Proven algebraically equivalent in Mathematica (verification/CouplingJacobianDerivation.m, 9/9 Ω substitutions).

## Mathematica Verification

Three Mathematica scripts provide symbolic and numerical verification of every identity and formula. All results are independently confirmed by the Rust test suite (95 tests).

| Script | Scope | Key result |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `SE3AlgebraVerification.m` | 24 SO(3)/SE(3)/BCH identities | Symbolic ✓ and numerical to 10⁻¹⁶ |
| `SaddlepointVerification.m` | Saddlepoint formula vs quadrature | 3000× improvement over Laplace (3.2×10⁻⁶ rel. error) |
| `CouplingJacobianDerivation.m` | d[S⁻¹T]/dΩ symbolic proof | 9/9 Ω substitutions → exact zero |

See **[verification/README.md](verification/README.md)** for detailed per-part results and Mathematica pitfalls.
