# Higher-Order Uncertainty Propagation and Saddlepoint Marginalization on SE(3)

**Author:** Frank O. Kuehnel

---

## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper *Higher-Order Uncertainty Propagation and Saddlepoint Marginalization on the SE(3) Lie Group*, which develops a self-contained framework for Bayesian inference over rigid body poses.

**Paper:** [SE3_inference_paper.pdf](paper/higherorder.pdf)

The core ideas originate from work at NASA Ames Research Center (2008) on robust pose estimation using the SE(3) Lie group structure. This project refocuses that foundational material—stripping away the SLAM-specific framing—into three standalone contributions aimed at the broader estimation and inference community. All formulas have been verified symbolically (Mathematica) and numerically (Rust, finite differences, Monte Carlo).

## What This Paper Contributes

### 1. Second-Order Uncertainty Propagation on SE(3)

Current filters and optimizers (EKF, IEKF, factor graphs) propagate pose uncertainty using first-order Jacobians. On SE(3), the semi-direct product coupling between rotation and translation introduces systematic bias that first-order methods miss. We derive:

- Closed-form composition Jacobians including the rotation-translation coupling Jacobian **J_t(Ω, t)**
- Second-order corrections to both the mean and covariance of composed poses
- Explicit formulas using the finite BCH composition via SU(2), avoiding truncated series

**Verified:** Monte Carlo validation (10⁵ samples) confirms a 1.83× improvement in covariance accuracy at σ_ω ≈ 0.2 rad. BCH truncation errors verified across 4 decades (see Table 1 in paper).

### 2. Saddlepoint Marginalization for Projective Observations

When camera observations are projective (x/z, y/z), the joint posterior over pose and 3D landmarks is non-Gaussian in the pose parameters. Standard Laplace approximation (Schur complement in bundle adjustment) misses this asymmetry. We develop:

- A saddlepoint correction with the **corrected formula** c₁ = (1/12)A + (1/8)B − (1/8)Q₄
- Two distinct cubic contraction types (cross: 6/15 Isserlis pairings, trace: 9/15)
- Quartic term with correct negative sign (from exp(−g₄) ≈ 1 − g₄)
- Validity guard: correction applied only when |c₁| < 0.5 (σ_depth/depth ≲ 0.3)

**Verified:** Against numerical quadrature, the saddlepoint achieves 6 significant figures (3.2×10⁻⁶ relative error) compared to Laplace's 0.94% error — a ~3000× improvement.

### 3. Complete SE(3) Algebra Toolkit

The paper provides a self-contained reference for the SE(3) machinery, all symbolically verified:

- Exponential/logarithmic maps with Lie-Cartan coordinates of the first kind
- Closed-form finite Rodrigues vector composition via the SU(2)/Z₂ ≅ SO(3) double cover
- Phase reflection handling at Θ = π with cutline analysis
- Wei-Norman formula and both left/right Rodrigues Jacobians
- Key identities: S⁻¹ = J_ωl, S⁻¹R = RS⁻¹ = J_ωr (verified to machine precision)

## Errata from Original Tech Report

The symbolic verification process uncovered three errors in the original 2008 formulation:

1. **Third derivative sign** (Appendix E, Eq. thirdderivs): ∂³u/∂x₃'³ = **−6u/x₃'³** (was +6u/x₃'³)
2. **Saddlepoint formula** (Appendix E, Eq. saddlepointfull): The original (5/24)A + (1/8)Q₄ was incorrect. The correct formula is **(1/12)A + (1/8)B − (1/8)Q₄** with two distinct contraction types and a sign flip on the quartic term.
3. **Coupling Jacobian** (Appendix C, Eq. dSinvTdOmega): The first term used the exponential coordinate **t** where the physical translation **T** was required. The Rust implementation uses numerical differentiation of S⁻¹(Ω)·T pending a corrected closed-form derivation.

### Key verified identities (Rust + Mathematica)

- BCH composition matches matrix log(R_a R_b) to 10⁻¹⁶ across all angle regimes
- Phase reflection at Θ > π produces correct (−r, 2π−Θ) identification

### Design Principles

- **No external dependencies for core algebra**: 3×3 and 6×6 matrices as fixed-size arrays, exploiting skew-symmetric and block-triangular structure
- **Zero heap allocation in inner loops**: SO(3) Jacobians are `[[f64; 3]; 3]`, SE(3) ones are `[[f64; 6]; 6]`
- **Defensive numerics**: Validity guard on saddlepoint (|c₁| > 0.5 → fall back to Laplace), Taylor expansions near singularities (Θ → 0, ε → 0)
- **Exhaustive FD validation**: Every Jacobian and derivative tested against central finite differences
